Yet another sourdough experiment. This time pushing the hydration and bulk fermentation.

## Recipe:
* 300g Caputo Manitoba Oro
* 60g 100% Hydration Starter (12h since feeding)
* 250g Water
* 6g Salt

## Method
* 5 coil folds spaced 30 minutes apart
* 7.5 hour bulk fermentation (new record)

## Results

### End of bulk fermentation

The dough as grown by more than 50%.

### Puffed up

This time the dough looks more like a yeast fermented dough.

### Finished

## Conclusion
I will keep pushing the bulk fermentation times up to the 9 hour mark and keep hydration at 83%.

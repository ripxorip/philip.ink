From time to time I suffer from *RSI* in my hands. This can be mitigated by using voice assisted coding using e.g.
[Talon](https://talonvoice.com/). After spending some time in the Talon discord I got recommended the **BP894** microphone.
The mic has been great but I have struggled to use it with my headphones. This weekend I decided to design a mount for it using
Solidworks.

## Adapter:

The main idea is to use the existing USB-C charging connector of the headphones for mechanical connection. One of the plastic parts
is designed to clamp around the connector.

## Mounted
